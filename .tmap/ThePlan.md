The Plan

## **Development Approach**

### **Phase 1: Basic Prototype**
- Write a script that extracts code blocks using one naming convention (e.g., header-based).
- Create or update files in a target directory.

### **Phase 2: Configurability**
- Add support for other naming conventions via settings.
- Include a reverse mode to insert files back into code blocks.

### **Phase 3: Sublime Text Integration**
- Turn the script into a Sublime Text plugin.
- Add commands to the Command Palette (e.g., `Extract Code Blocks`, `Insert Code Blocks`).
- Add key bindings and menu options.

## **Monetization**

1. **Open Source with Sponsorships**:
   - Release the plugin for free and add a GitHub Sponsor or Patreon link.
   - Offer extra features to sponsors.

2. **Freemium Model**:
   - Free core features, paid pro features (e.g., more naming conventions, integrations with GitHub or version control).

3. **Commercial Licensing**:
   - Sell the plugin directly on platforms like Gumroad.

4. **Enterprise Version**:
   - Market it to teams or companies working with large markdown repositories.

## **Next Steps**

1. **Start Prototyping**:
   - Choose a language (Python for Sublime Text plugins).
   - Write the markdown parser and file generator logic.

2. **Collaborate**:
   - Share the initial prototype, and I can help refine it.

3. **Monetization Research**:
   - Explore similar tools (e.g., Markdown managers, snippet tools).
   - Test user interest in features like GitHub integration or automation.

## **Free vs. Paid Version Strategy**

### **Features for the Free Version**
- Core functionality:
  - Extract code blocks to files.
  - Insert file contents back into markdown files.
  - Configurable naming conventions.
- Local-only operations:
  - Users can only work with local directories.

### **Features for the Paid (Commercial) Version**
- **Version Control Integration**:
  - Automate pushing and pulling changes to/from GitHub, GitLab, or other version control systems.
  - Allow tracking changes to both markdown files and extracted files.

- **Collaboration**:
  - Shared directories for teams.
  - Resolve merge conflicts in code blocks collaboratively.

- **Advanced Features**:
  - Bulk operations on multiple markdown files.
  - Notifications for file changes in shared directories.
  - Custom rules or templates for naming conventions.

## **Protecting the Paid Version**

1. **Technical Safeguards**
   - **License Key Verification**:
     - Require a valid license key for paid features. Validate the key via a secure online service.
     - Encrypt sensitive logic to make reverse engineering more challenging.
   - **Code Obfuscation**:
     - Obfuscate parts of the paid version’s code to deter modification.
   - **Feature Restrictions**:
     - Embed checks for collaborative features (e.g., API calls, network sharing) that rely on external services, making it harder to replicate without paying.

2. **Non-Technical Safeguards**
   - **Trust Factor**:
     - Many companies value their reputation and adhere to license agreements.
   - **Terms of Use**:
     - Clearly outline what constitutes free and commercial use in your license agreement. This can also help enforce your rights legally.

3. **Custom Implementation Safeguards**
   - Offer direct support or customization for companies purchasing the commercial version. Companies are unlikely to risk modifying free software if they need regular updates or custom features.

## **Pricing Strategy**

### **Considerations**
- **Target Market**: Your target market includes individual developers (free) and small to mid-sized teams or companies (paid).
- **Perceived Value**: This tool saves time and boosts productivity, especially for teams dealing with collaborative documentation.
- **Competitor Pricing**: Check similar tools for pricing benchmarks.
- **Scalability**: Consider tiered pricing if adding more advanced features later.

### **Suggested Pricing**
- **Free Tier**: Unlimited use for individuals with local-only functionality.
- **Paid Tier**:
  - **$5–$10 per user/month** for small teams.
  - **$15–$30 per user/month** for companies requiring advanced features like version control and collaboration.

Alternatively, offer **lifetime licenses** (e.g., $50–$100 per user) for smaller businesses and $500+ for larger teams.
